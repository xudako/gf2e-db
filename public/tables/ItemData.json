Under the influence of the Collapse Storm, the metal parts were covered with multiple layers of hard copolymer shells, and the interior was also eroded by the Collapse Particles, making it impossible to trace its previous function and form. It can be combined with glass-like crystals in the analysis machine to make a location-oriented carrier card. It will be collected after the current Boundary Chronicle Project is completed.",
